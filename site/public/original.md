## Research Experience

07/2021 - Present
  ~ **Machine Learning Engineer Intern**, Slow Feet Technology, Beijing

- Devised a new food-agnostic formulation for fine-grained cross-ingredient meal cooking and subsumed the recent popular works into the proposed scheme
- Proposed a cream of mushroom soup recipe which is competitive when compared with the SOTA recipes with complex steps by only altering the way of cutting mushroom, **submitted to NeurIPS 2099**
- Developed a pan for meal cooking which is benefiting the group members' research work


08/2020 - Present
  ~ **Reseach Intern**, Paddling University, Beijing

- Designed an efficient method for mapo tofu quality estimation via thermometer
- Proposed a fast stir frying algorithm for tofu cooking problems, which specifies the amount of the hot sauce instead of using terms like "as much as you can", **submitted to CVPR 2099**
- Outperformed SOTA methods while cooking much more efficient in experiments on popular tofu


03/2020 - 06/2020
  ~ **Research Assistant**, Huangdu Institute of Technology, Shanghai

- Proposed a novel framework consisting of a spoon and a pair of chopsticks for eating mapo toufu, **published in NeurIPS 2077**
- Designed a tofu filtering strategy inspired by beans grinding method for building a dataset for this new task
- Designed two new evaluation criteria to assess the novelty and diversity of the eating plans
- Outperformed baselines and existed methods substantially in terms of diversity, novelty and coherence


07/2018 - 08/2018
  ~ **Reseach Intern**, Paddling University, Beijing

- Designed two sandwiches consisting of breads and meat of two traditional bacon cheese burgers to make use of unused ingredients
- Utilized the structure duality to boost the cooking speed of two dual tasks based on shared ingredients
- Outperformed strong baselines on QWE'15 and ASDF'14 dataset


## Awards and Honors
